This is VSCode extension project.
The extension that allows you to show translation in the editor.
How this extension works:
 - Get config from .vscode/show-translation.json file.
 - Get translation data from JSON files.
 - Show translation in the editor when any text matching matchStrings in config is hovered.
 - Suggest translation when typing "." (dot) after matchStrings in config.
 - Ctrl+Click to open the JSON file and move to the corresponding key location.
 - Support any languages in vscode supports. Declare in config file. Default is javascript, typescript, html.
 - Working independent, not effect other extensions. Even if other extensions fail.
